Python program

- A Python program is a sequence of Python statements
  - Stored in a text file called a Python module
  - Executed using an IDE or ‚Äúfrom the command line‚Äù

- line1 = 'Hello Python developer...'
- line2 = 'Welcome to the world of Python!'
- print(line1)
- print(line2)

line2 = 'Welcome to the world of Python!'

print(line1)

print(line2)

line1 = 'Hello Python developer...'

hello.py

- $ python hello.py

## Slide 3

Introduction to Computing Using Python

Built-in function print()

- Function print() prints its input argument to the IDLE window
  - The argument can be any object: an integer, a float, a string, a list, ‚Ä¶
    - Strings are printed without quotes  and ‚Äúto be read by people‚Äù, rather than ‚Äúto be interpreted by Python‚Äù,
  - The ‚Äústring representation‚Äù of the object is printed

```python
print(0)
# Output: 0
print(0.0)
# Output: 0.0
print('zero')
# Output: zero
print([0, 1, 'two'])
# Output: [0, 1, 'two']
```

## Slide 5

Introduction to Computing Using Python

Built-in function eval()

- Function input() evaluates anything
- the user enters as a string
- What if we want the user to interactively enter non-string input such as a number?
  - Solution 1: Use type conversion
  - Solution 2: Use function eval()
    - Takes a string as input and evaluates it as a Python expression

```python
age = input('Enter your age: ')
# Output: Enter your age: 18
age
# Output: '18'
int(age)
# Output: 18
eval('18')
# Output: 18
eval('age')
# Output: '18'
eval('[2,3+5]')
# Output: [2, 8]
eval('x')
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#14>", line 1, in <module>
- eval('x')
- File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
- NameError: name 'x' is not defined

```python
age = input('Enter your age: ')
# Output: Enter your age: 18
age
# Output: '18'
int(age)
# Output: 18
```

```python
age = input('Enter your age: ')
# Output: Enter your age: 18
age
# Output: '18'
```

## Slide 13

Introduction to Computing Using Python

Execution control structures

  - The one-way and two-way if statements are examples of execution control structures
  - Execution control structures are programming language statements that control which statements are executed, i.e., the execution flow of the program
  - The one-way and two-way if statements are, more specifically,  conditional structures
  - Iteration structures are execution control structures that enable the repetitive execution of a statement or a block of statements
  - The for loop statement is an iteration structure that executes a block of code for every item of a sequence

Built-in function range()

Function range() is used to iterate over a sequence of numbers in a specified range

```python
for i in range(4):
# Output: print(i)
# Output: 0
# Output: 1
# Output: 2
# Output: 3
```

  - To iterate over the n numbers 0, 1, 2, ‚Ä¶, n-1
    - for i in range(n):

  - To iterate over the n numbers i, i+1, i+2, ‚Ä¶, n-1
    - for i in range(i, n):

## Slide 19

Introduction to Computing Using Python

Defining new functions

- A few built-in functions we have seen:
  - abs(), max(), len(),
    - sum(), print()

```python
abs(-9)
# Output: 9
max(2, 4)
# Output: 4
lst = [2,3,4,5]
len(lst)
# Output: 4
sum(lst)
# Output: 14
print()
```

New functions can be defined using def

- def f(x):
- res = x**2 + 10
- return res

def:  function definition keyword

f:  name of function

x:  variable name for input argument

return:  specifies function output

```python
abs(-9)
# Output: 9
max(2, 4)
# Output: 4
lst = [2,3,4,5]
len(lst)
# Output: 4
sum(lst)
# Output: 14
print()
def f(x):
# Output: res = 2*x + 10
```

- return x**2 + 10

```python
abs(-9)
# Output: 9
max(2, 4)
# Output: 4
lst = [2,3,4,5]
len(lst)
# Output: 4
sum(lst)
# Output: 14
print()
def f(x):
# Output: res = 2*x + 10
```

- return x**2 + 10
```python
f(1)
# Output: 11
f(3)
# Output: 19
f(0)
# Output: 10
```

---

<a id="slide-20"></a>

## Slide 20

Introduction to Computing Using Python

print() versus return

- def f(x):
- res = x**2 + 10
- return res

- def f(x):
- res = x**2 + 10
- print(res)

```python
f(2)
# Output: 14
```

```python
f(2)
# Output: 14
```

Function returns value of res which can then be used in an expression

- Function prints value of res
- but does not return anything

```python
f(2)
# Output: 14
2*f(2)
# Output: 28
```

```python
f(2)
# Output: 14
2*f(2)
# Output: 14
# Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
```

- File "<pyshell#56>", line 1, in <module>
- 2*f(2)

Introduction to Computing Using Python

Defining new functions

- def <function name> (<0 or more variables>):
- <indented function body>

- def hyp(a, b):

a

b

c

```python
hyp(3,4)
# Output: 5.0
```

The general format of a function definition is

- Let‚Äôs develop function hyp() that:
  - Takes two numbers as input (side lengths a and b of above right triangle )
  - Returns the length of the hypotenuse c

- import math
- def hyp(a, b):
- res = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)

- import math
- def hyp(a, b):
- res = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
- return res

Comments and docstrings

- Python programs should be documented
  - So the developer who writes/maintains the code understands it
  - So the user knows what the program does

Comments

- def f(x):
- res = x**2 + 10   # compute result
- return res        # and return it

- def f(x):
- 'returns x**2 + 10'
- res = x**2 + 10   # compute result
- return res        # and return it

A variable does not exist before it is assigned

- <expression> is evaluated and its value put into an object of appropriate type
- The object is assigned name <variable>

```

6

```python
a
# Output: 3
a = 6
a
# Output: 6
```

- The object (3) referred to by variable a does not change; instead, a refers to a new object (6)
  - Integers are immutable

```python
a
# Output: 3
a = 6
a
# Output: 6
d
# Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

- The object ([1, 2, 3]) referred to by d changes
  - Lists are mutable

[1, 7, 3]

```python
a
# Output: 3
a = 6
a
# Output: 6
d
# Output: [1, 2, 3]
d[1] = 7
d
# Output: [1, 7, 3]
```

- The list that c refers to changes; d refers to the same list object, so it changes too
    - Because lists are mutable, a change to d affects c

c
# Output: [1, 7, 3]
d[2] = 9
c
# Output: [1, 7, 9]
```

[1, 7, 9]

a and b refer to the same integer object

- a now refers to a new object (9); b still refers to the old object (6)
    - Because integers are immutable, a change to a does not affect the value of b

c and d refer to the same list object

a = 3
```

```python
a = 3
g(a)
```

```python
a = 3
g(a)
```

- Function g() did not, and cannot, modify the value of a in the interactive shell.
- This is because a refers to an immutable object.

- def g(x):
- x = 5

- def g(x):
- x = 5

- Variable x inside g() refers to the object a refers to
- As if we executed x = a

- Write function swapFS() that:
  - takes a list as input
  - swaps the first and second element of the list, but only if the list has at least two elements
- The function does not return anything
